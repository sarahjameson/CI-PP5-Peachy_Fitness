### Development Planes
To prepare for this project, I researched other fitness brand websites. This preparation helped me create the user stories. Some of the websites I used were:
- [Gymshark](https://eu.gymshark.com/)
- [Gym plus Coffee](https://gympluscoffee.com/)
- [Shreddy](https://shreddy.com/)

#### Strategy
With this website, I concentrated on the following aspects:
- Roles
    - Site User
    - Site Owner
- Demographic
    - Women/girls around 14-40
    - Fitness enthusiasts
- Psychographics
    - Personality & Attitudes:
        - Playful
        - Sporty
        - Outgoing
        - Motivated

    - Values:
        - Has a growth mindset
        - Positive
        - Fashionable

    - Lifestyles:
        - Has friends who have similar interests such as hiking or other outdoor activities
        - Keeps up with the latest trends
        - Likes trying out different things like Irish dancing or painting etc
        - Likes to look good

I found that the website needs to enable the **Site User** to:
- Find attractive and high quality exercise products for women in all sizes.
- Add the desired products to the shopping bag for purchasing.
- Filter the products based on name, categories, rating and prices.
- Search products by name or description.
- Create a profile with the saved user info and past orders.

The website needs to enable the **Site Owner** to:
- Add, edit and delete products on the site.
- View orders on the admin panel.

##### **eCommerce Application Type and Marketing Strategy**
To create a site that fit the user's needs, I planned the following marketing strategy:

- **eCommerce Type:**
    - **B2C** - I used SEO (Search Engine Optimisation), Content Marketing in the form of a newsletter, and Social Media Marketing in the form of a Facebook and Instagram page.

- Marketing Types:
    - **SEO** - SEO is useful for ensuring a good online presence. It is important to be present in the digital landscape as this form is everywhere around us and an important platform for a business. SEO must be carefully managed to not be treated as spam. I tried to avoid spaming the page content with words. I made sure to fill the meta tag with valuable keywords and a useful description.

    - **Content Marketing** - I used a newsletter. This marketing can help keep the business stay in the mind of the customer and convey a personality to them also. It allows the store to talk about what they are most knowledgable about and as a result build confidence in the users reading the content.

    - **Social Media Marketing** - I used Organic Social Media Marketing. It is a free and easy way to get a brand across. The site can be shared with others and special events or sales can be shared free of charge. This allows the store to connect directly with the consumer and build relationships and loyalty with the customers. This form of marketing can also be used to improve the store's customer service and support. Issues can be dealt with publically in a friendly or even funny way. The social media chosen for this project was [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Peachy-Fitness-104511555665795).

![Facebook Page for Peachy Fitness](media/README/facebook.png)

### **Scope**
I defined a scope to identify what needed to be done to align features with the strategy previously defined. This was broken into two categories:

- **Content Requirements**
    - The user will be looking for:
        - A variety of products to choose from that come under fitness goals
        - Details of the products provided
        - A way to search the site using the name or description fields
        - A filtering function by rating, name, price and category
        - A  Profile Page displaying the user's saved address and past order
- **Functionality Requirements**
    - The user will be able to:
        - Select their desired size for each product
        - Update their profile with with a address
        - Easily navigate the site to find product information

#### **Structure**
The website was organized in a hierarchical tree structure to ensure that users could navigate through the site with easily.

#### **Skeleton**
I created the Wireframe mockups using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/). Please find the file below:
- [Wireframes](media/README/wireframes)

### Design
#### **Colour Scheme**
The colour scheme was influenced by the home page photo. The purple and pink are fun playful colours. A very faint purple was used as a contrast to the deeper purple and pink.

![](media/README/colour-scheme.png)

#### **Typography**
The font chosen for the headings was Dancing Script. All the other test was done in Mulish. The Dancing Script was used as the logo. It is fun and elegant. Mulish is very modern and trendy. It is easy to read.

#### **Imagery**
The imagery used in this site is entirely related to the products being sold - exercise goods.

## Issues and Bugs 
Below are some issues that I ran into while creating this project:
- Jquery was not working at first. It turns out I had the wrong link.
- I had a few issues with html and rows. Things were not in the correct place. One such example was my footer. I had to carefully read through the code and see that the tags were in the correct place.
- The Javascript script that I was using for the toast notifications was one for Bootstrap4 so they were not working properly. I read through the bootstrap5 documentation on toasts and eventually figured out what to do.
- I was receiving a programming error when trying to refresh the heroku site. It turns out that I needed to run migrations from the Heroku CLI as well.

## Deployment 
For the project, I used the [GitPod](https://gitpod.io/) cloud development IDE. I committed the code to Git and then pushed to [GitHub](https://github.com/) using the terminal. After, I deployed to code to [Heroku](https://heroku.com/).

### Deploying on Heroku
To deploy this page to Heroku from its GitHub repository, the following steps were taken:

1. Create the Heroku App:
    - Select "Create new app" in Heroku.
    - Choose a name for your app and select the location.

2. Attach the Postgres database:
    - In the Resources tab, under add-ons, type in Postgres and select the Heroku Postgres option.

3. Prepare the environment and settings.py file:
    - In the Settings tab, click on Reveal Config Vars and copy the URL next to DATABASE_URL.
    - In your GitPod workspace, create an env.py file in the main directory. 
    - Add the DATABASE_URL value and your chosen SECRET_KEY value to the env.py file.
    - Add the SECRET_KEY value to the Config Vars in Heroku.
    - Update the settings.py file to import the env file and add the SECRETKEY and DATABASE_URL file paths.
    - Update the Config Vars with the Cloudinary URL, adding into the settings.py file also.
    - In settings.py add the following sections:
        - STATIC_URL
        - STATICFILES_DIRS
        - MEDIA_URL
        - MEDIA_ROOT
        - TEMPLATES_DIR
        - Update DIRS in TEMPLATES with TEMPLATES_DIR
        - Update ALLOWED_HOSTS with ['app_name.herokuapp.com', 'localhost']

4. Set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC and Deploy to Heroku:
    - Create three directories in the main directory; media, storage and templates.
    - Create a file named "Procfile" in the main directory and add the following:
        - web: gunicorn project-name.wsgi
    - in the terminal, log in to Heroku and then enter the following:
        - heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 --app (Heroku App Name)
    - Go to the 'Deploy' tab on Heroku and connect to GitHub, then to the required repository.
    Click on 'Deploy Branch' and wait for the build to load. When the build is complete, the app can be opened through Heroku. 

### Forking the Repository
By forking the GitHub Repository, we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps:

1. Log into [GitHub](https://github.com/login "Link to GitHub login page") or [create an account](https://github.com/join "Link to GitHub create account page").
2. Locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/rebeccatraceyt/KryanLive "Link to GitHub Repo").
3. At the top of the repository, on the right side of the page, select "Fork"
4. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.
